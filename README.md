    General Instructions: 

    •	Your assignment should be a Python program

    •	Your assignment will use what we have learned so far 
    (e.g. conditional statements, array, array built-in functions, and loop).

    •	You may also utilize the Internet as an extra source to help with your code.
    For example, you might need some useful built-in array functions,

    e.g. shuffle () if you use arrays to do this assignment.
    However, there are many correct ways to write a program.
    All roads lead to Rome.
